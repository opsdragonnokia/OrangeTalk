If excitement is not a regular part of your relationship, you will tend to channel frustrated energy into conflict and argument, and the relationship will be somewhat stormy.  You yourself tend to be great at initiating activities, but not too good at setting goals with your partner and working toward them. This is often why your dreamed-of adventures may never take place.  Typically, you tend to act as if your partner is an extension of yourself and not a separate individual.  While this behavior can quickly lead to a blissful physical rapport, it can also be highly irritating in a relationship.  By assuming that your pleasure is also your mate's pleasure, you may not be sensitive to your partner's needs which may be separate from your own.  You may not be aware of the nurturing and emotional support your partner needs simply because you are too involved in fulfilling your own needs.

You need security in your relationships, and will both give and seek constant reassurances of devotion, and this \"clinging\" can become quite stifling to some partners.

Sex and sensuality are extremely important in your relationship, and you are not likely to place your partner's satisfaction over your own. If your sex life is not physically satisfying, your frustration may develop into bitterness and resentment toward your partner.
